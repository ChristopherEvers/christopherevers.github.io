            How much caffeine is in a cup of coffee?
          </li>
          <li>
            <br />
            Caffeine content in different types of coffee can vary. A standard
            cup of coffee (around 8oz) will contain an average of 94.8mg of
            caffeine. An Espresso on the other hand will have an average of 63mg
            of caffeine, and a standard latte will contain an average of 77mg of
            caffeine. The caffeine content depends on the size, strength and
            type of coffee you are consuming.

          <li class="question">
            <br />How many calories are in a cup of coffee?
          </li>
          <li>
            <br />
            Depending on the type of coffee you are drinking, the amount of
            calories will differ significantly. Adding extras such as milk,
            sugar and syrup will all directly affect the calorie content of a
            coffee. A standard cup of black coffee (around 8oz) contains 1
            calorie, but a cappuccino for example can contain anywhere from 60
            to 160 calories, depending on the type of milk you take and the size
            of the cappuccino. For a low calorie coffee, switch the sugar to
            sweeteners, and switch full milk to skim or soy (or cut out the milk
            altogether!).

          <li class="question"><br />What is fair trade coffee?</li>
          <li>
            <br />
            Fair trade coffee is coffee that has been produced by a cooperative
            of farmers, importers, exporters and distributors that follow the
            standards set out by the FairTrade organisation. The FairTrade stamp
            on coffee is a certificate that guarantees the cooperative involved
            in the production of the coffee adhered to it’s standards, which
            include: set wages for farmers; environmentally sustainable
            practices; safe working conditions; exclusion of child labour; and
            agro-ecological practices, including reducing the use of chemical
            fertiliser and protecting forests.

          <li class="question"><br />Is coffee bad for you?<l/i></li>
          <li>
            <br />
            Overall, coffee can have a lot of positive effects on the body. It’s
            health benefits include reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes,
            improving the resting metabolic rate, and can even reduce the risk
            of certain types of cancers. Coffee can help ward off cognitive
            decline and boost long-term memory, and even reduce the risk of
            Alzheimer’s disease. As well as these physical effects, coffee
            contains a large amount of nutrients and antioxidants such as
            vitamins B2, B3 and B5. The negatives of coffee are considerably
            smaller – becoming addicted to coffee and suffering withdrawal
            symptoms such as headaches is one example. The positives largely
            outweigh the negatives, but if you are drinking a large amount of
            coffee it could lead to disrupting your sleep due to a large
            caffeine intake.

          <li class="question"><br />Can you drink coffee while pregnant?</li>
          <li>
            <br />
            You can drink coffee while you are pregnant, although it is
            recommended to limit the amount of caffeine you consume to around
            200mg – which is about the equivalent of two mugs of coffee.
            Drinking more than this while pregnant could increase the risk of
            miscarriage, or having a baby with a low birth weight. Ultimately,
            the decision to consume caffeine is up to you, but you can cut down
            by switching to decaffeinated drinks and having smaller cups of
            coffee.
          </li>

          <li class="question"><br />Where does coffee come from?</li>
          <li>
            <br />
            Coffee is made from coffee beans, which are grown along the ‘Bean
            Belt’. This includes countries such as Brazil, Columbia, Vietnam,
            Indonesia and Mexico. Coffee beans are harvested from the coffee
            tree as cherries, before going through a wet or dry process to
            ensure the beans are the correct moisture. The beans are then milled
            before being exported to their destination. From there, beans are
            roasted, and are sold whole or are ground down to fine or coarse
            grinds to be sold in shops.
          </li>

          <li class="question">
            <br />How many cups of coffee is it safe to drink a day?
          </li>
          <li>
            <br />
            On average, the regular person is safe drinking 3-5 cups of coffee a
            day. Ultimately, its up to you to understand how your body responds
            to coffee, and to judge when you shouldn’t have any more. If you
            respond well to large amounts of caffeine, and don’t become jittery
            or get stomach pain, then you can drink what you want, but if you
            know that drinking lots of coffee keeps you up at night and leads to
            headaches in the morning, cut down to 3 cups a day. Drinking more
            than 5 cups of coffee a day has been linked to a raise in
            cholesterol, so if you’re a heavy coffee drinker sticking to 5 is
            the recommended amount.
          </li>

          <li class="question"><br />Why does coffee make me feel tired?</li>
          <li>
            <br />
            Coffee is best known for it’s high levels of natural caffeine – so
            why does it leave some of us feeling tired? There are a variety of
            reasons that caffeine affects you differently to how it affects
            others. One reason, for example, could be that drinking coffee for
            so long has meant that you have formed a mild tolerance, so the
            caffeine kick you expect is lacking. Another reason could be due to
            coffee’s properties as a diuretic – you may be dehydrated, and by
            the time the caffeine has worn off, you may be feeling more tired
            than usual.
          </li>

          <li class="question">
            <br />Which has more caffeine – coffee or tea?
          </li>
          <li>
            <br />
            There is significantly less caffeine in the average cup of tea than
            there is in coffee. Before tea has been prepared and brewed, its dry
            form does contain more caffeine, but once brewed it’s caffeine
            content drops. We also use less tea to make a cup than we do coffee.
            1 cup (8oz) of coffee contains around 94mg of caffeine, whereas an
            8oz cup of tea only contains 26mg of caffeine.
          </li>

          <li class="question"><br />What coffee has the most caffeine?</li>
          <li>
            <br />
            The caffeine content of a coffee is dictated by a few factors. First
            of all, the type of coffee bean used will affect its caffeine
            levels. Robusto coffee beans have the highest caffeine levels,
            whereas Arabica coffee beans contain half of this. A longer brewing
            time also means more caffeine – a French press for example is brewed
            for around 4 minutes so it will contain a decent amount of caffeine.
            An espresso on the other hand is only brewed for 20-30 seconds but
            because of it’s serving size, the caffeine content is more
            concentrated and therefore higher. Normal coffee has the highest
            content because of its brewing time (94mg), but espressos are a
            close second (63mg). Behind these are filter coffee, lattes and
            cappuccinos.
          </li>

          <li class="question">
            <br />What are the different types of coffee beans?
          </li>
          <li>
            <br />
            There are two main types of coffee bean: Coffee Robusta and Coffee
            Arabica. Coffee Robusta are a lower grade of beans, and are grown at
            lower altitudes. They are easy to maintain and are more disease
            resistant, meaning that they produce more. They also contain a
            larger amount of caffeine. Coffee Arabica make up for more than
            three-quarters of beans sold worldwide. They are referred to as
            gourmet coffee beans but only have half the amount of caffeine that
            Coffee Robusta has.

          <li class="question"><br />Why did coffee become popular?</li>
          <li>
            <br />
            Coffee is the most popular beverage in the world, but how did it
            become that? The coffee bean’s history stretches back centuries.
            Tracing its origins to Ethiopia and the Arabian Peninsula, coffee
            was as popular then as it is now. Coffee houses started to gain
            traction around the 17th century in Europe, and the Boston Tea Party
            famously made the change from tea to coffee in 1773, leading to a
            boom of coffee popularity in America. Soldiers soon became addicted
            to coffee during WW2, as they used coffee to keep their energy
            levels high, and the invention of the television soon afterwards
            became a platform for instant coffee to be advertised. From here, a
            rise in modern coffee houses appeared, before coffee giant Starbucks
            materialised. From there, coffee has continued to become the most
            popular drink across the globe.
          </li>

          <li class="question"><br />What makes a good coffee?</li>
          <li>
            <br />
            Good coffee ultimately comes down to taste – but there will be some
            who tell you that there are certain ways to make a coffee perfect.
            The trick is to buy your own beans and grind them when necessary, as
            coffee beans can go stale if they have been open too long and the
            taste of ground beans can change over time. If you live somewhere
            with hard water, like in London, buying water filters helps to
            ensure a smooth coffee, and to keep an eye on the temperature and
            brewing time, as coffee can be burnt easily. Coffee also tastes of
            what it has been brewed in, so a clean coffee maker is always
            essential. Of course, you don’t need to buy your own beans and grind
            them, as you may prefer the coffee you buy regularly, but coffee
            beans are renowned as tasting better.
